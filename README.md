# purescript-fast-ide-vscode

This extension is in alpha and will probably have many bugs.

It's goal is to be a fast IDE that is performant on large projects and doesn't consume too much memory. 

If you have a small or medium sized project you will probably be better off using https://github.com/nwolverson/vscode-ide-purescript.

To use this project you will have to install a fork of the purs compiler with LSP support. 
This can be installed at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxfordabstracts/purescript-lsp
